# DESCRIPTION OF TASK

The java File Handling Utility is a simple yet efficient program designed to perform basic file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files. It provides an easy way to handle files programmatically using core Java file I/O classes, making it useful for developers, students, beginners in Java.

*Technologies Used*
> Java SE
> File Handling APIs (File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter)
> Exception Handling

*Features*
1. Write to a file: Create a file and write content to it.
2. Read from a file: Read content from and existing file
3. Modifying a file: Appends new data to a file.
4. Error Handling: Uses try-catch block to handle errors.


*How it works*
> The program prompts user to select an operation (read, write, or modify).
> If writing/modifying, the user enters text, which is then saved in the file.
> If reading, the program retrieves and displays the file's content.
> All file streams are properly used.


*Future Enhancements*
> Binary file handling support.
> GUI for better user experience.
> Encryption for secure file storage.
